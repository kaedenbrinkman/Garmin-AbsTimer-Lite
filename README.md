# Garmin-AbsTimer-Lite
 A version of the AbsTimer app for older Garmin devices

For the full version, see [kaedenbrinkman/Garmin-AbsTimer](https://github.com/kaedenbrinkman/Garmin-AbsTimer/)

The reason that this app exists is because I used the Menu2 class to enable customizeable routine names. However, this class requires SDK 3.X, whereas a couple of the older Garmin devices such as the Forerunner 235 only support 1.3.X. This app is pretty much the same as the full version except that the menu for switching between routines is fixed.
